Present for Paul-Louis starring his famous [robotic teapot](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/plasteac/tree/master/) :)

This project uses models from Paul-Louis' project (which in turn is based on the Utah Teapot) to create a joyful Christmas scene as his Secret Santa present. At the moment, everything is hard-coded for lack of time to create nicer components. In the future, I'd like to split the pieces of the legs up and animate them so that the teapots could dance around. The tiers of the "theater" reflect my hope to orchestrate concentric rings of dancing teapots. Maybe by the 25th.

The hat model added to the teapot was downloaded [here](https://www.models-resource.com/pc_computer/roblox/model/18759/).

Merry Christmas, Paulo!
